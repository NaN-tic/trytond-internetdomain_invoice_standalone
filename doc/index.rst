Invoice lines from domain renewals
==================================

When a domain is renewed, invoice lines are created from the products related to
the domain. These invoice lines can be invoiced later by the Account Invoice
Standalone module.

Creation of invoice lines
-------------------------

One or more invoice lines will be created when:

* A new domain renewal is created.
* The domain has one or more products. A new invoice line will be created for
  each product of the domain.
